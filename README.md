# U3-C1-Admin-Panel

Hello, Everyone
As the part of our evaluation, We have assigned the task to create a small admin panel, which accepts inputs data, such as type, images, price and etc.
As I have created this panel using CSS HTML and mainly for the functionality JS has been used.
As index page is containing of some inputs, and the data entered into this it stores in the local storage.
As the product are arranged in grid manner, with the product image, type price and as well as the Remove Button.
When the remove button is clicked, the product is removed from the webpage as well as from the local storage to.
Even if we want to add more products and the data for it, the button on the head Add More Products redirects it to the index page.
Thank You!
